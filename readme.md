## Project Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase how to build a maintainable and scalable software application by leveraging modern software development practices. It emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and domain-centric design.

## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that promotes the separation of concerns within a software application. This repository follows the Clean Architecture principles by dividing the application into distinct layers:

- **Entities:** Represents the core business objects and logic.
- **Use Cases (Interactors):** Contains application-specific use cases or business logic.
- **Adapters:** Connects the application to external dependencies like databases, APIs, or frameworks.
- **Frameworks and Drivers:** Contains the UI and external frameworks used by the application.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. In this repository, TDD is employed to ensure that every piece of code is thoroughly tested. The `test` directory contains all the unit and integration tests necessary to validate the application's functionality.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a design approach that focuses on creating a shared understanding of the domain among all stakeholders. This repository employs DDD principles to model the domain logic effectively. The `src/domain` directory contains domain entities, value objects, and aggregates, while the `src/usecases` directory contains the application's use cases, repositories, and domain services.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help create maintainable and scalable software. Each SOLID principle is followed to ensure code readability and extensibility:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools are used in this project:

- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework for writing unit and integration tests.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- (Add any other technologies or libraries specific to your project)
